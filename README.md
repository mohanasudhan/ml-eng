# ml-eng
This package is used to learn the basics of ml from engineering prespective

# Tenant:

1. Ensure that the learning created in this package is easy to understand and self-contained.
2. If any prerequisites are required, state them explicitly.
3. Include more code examples and ensure that the dependencies are easy to install.
4. Opt for the simplest approach if there are multiple ways to achieve the same goal. The focus is on learning and creating a mental model rather than covering a wide array of possibilities.
5. This is not a complete suite. As a developer, I often navigate through different tools to understand certain concepts. I aim to consolidate them into one place.
