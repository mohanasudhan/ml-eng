Encoding involves converting categories into numeric representations, while 
embedding converts categories into continuous vectors.

Encoding includes techniques like one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, and binary encoding.
One-hot encoding represents each category with a binary vector, suitable for nominal data.
Ordinal encoding assigns unique integers to categories based on their order, suitable for
ordinal data. Binary encoding combines ordinal and one-hot encoding, converting ordinal
numbers into binary code.
